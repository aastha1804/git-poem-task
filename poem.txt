Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king's horses and all the king's men,
Couldn't put Humpty together again!

They called the doctor and called the nurse,
But Humpty's fall had made it worse.
With every crack and every tear,
The king's men sighed in deep despair.

But Humpty smiled and said with glee,
"There's no need to worry about me!
I'll roll away and find my way,
Tomorrow will be a brighter day!"

So off he went, with a cheerful heart,
And found new friends to make a start.
For even when you're cracked or small,
You can rise again after a fall!
